<p align="center">my experience while working at Secret Recipe, many sweet and bitter memories while working. I tried to apply to be a cafe crew at Secret Recipe area at my home because that was the only job advertisement that i saw on a Facebook group.</p>

<p align="center">The interview with the supervisor took less than 5 minutes, and I was immediately accepted to work (HAHAHAHAA)...Actually, they really urgently need new staff because there are not enough people. I started working when I was 18 years old.. At that time I was waiting for my SPM results...</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Secret Recipe KB Mall Kota Bharu was my first place to work. I was 'offered' to be a 'barista' at first but because of a little problem I was sent to the 'kitchen'. . I willingly became a chef in one month.. That's right, I didn't even bother to enter the kitchen, I was able to enter the 'kitchen' to cook, cut tomatoes, cucumbers, shrimp soup, make mushroom soup and many other things. I had a lot of fun and was happy to work there with new friends.. Various dishes I did, the dish I like to do the most is 'Pan Grill Dory' (fish fillet in a sal). ut aroma) is very challenging to prepare the dish.. The pictures below are just a few of my memories while at Secret Recipe KB Mall Kota Bharu..</p>
